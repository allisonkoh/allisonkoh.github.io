<!-- ## Hello! -->

I am a PhD Candidate at the [Hertie School's Centre for International Security ](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) in Berlin. I use computational methods to study online disinformation, transnational repression, and coercive power dynamics on social media. I am generally interested in studying the role of social media platforms in the production of rhetoric that supports state-sponsored violence. In my dissertation, I focus on how pro-government actors from authoritarian regimes can leverage the vulnerabilities of social media to influence transnational information flows, even on platforms where their governments do not have direct provision over content moderation. 
<!-- Outside of my research, I am enthusiastic about all things `R` and data visualization. I am also an advocate for diverse, accessible, and interdisciplinary communities in academic/professional settings.    -->

In a past life, I was a [Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Malaysia](https://www.macee.org.my/fulbright-eta-malaysia/) and happened to get a BSc in Economics and Asian Studies from Tulane University after living in New Orleans for four years. 

<!-- My experiences with internet/life under authoritarianism that inform my research stem from three years of studying Mandarin Chinese, and a year of living in Shanghai and Beijing. -->
