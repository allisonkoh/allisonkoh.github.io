<!-- ## Hello! -->

I am a PhD Candidate at the [Centre for International Security, Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) and Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Berlin Graduate School for Global and Transregional Studies](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/birt/bgts/index.html). My dissertation research focuses on the "grey areas" of digital transnational repression, or the broader implications of online smear campaigns and other forms of grey propaganda. I am broadly interested in studying disinformation, digital repression, and applications of natural language processing in social science research. Outside of my research, I am enthusiastic about all things `R`/ data visualization, being an (amateur) gamer, and advocating for a more neuroinclusive world.   

In a past life, I was a [Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Malaysia](https://fulbrightmalaysiaeta.wordpress.com/) and happened to get a BSc in Economics and Asian Studies from Tulane University after living in New Orleans for four years. 

<!-- My experiences with internet/life under authoritarianism that inform my research stem from three years of studying Mandarin Chinese, and a year of living in Shanghai and Beijing. -->
