<!-- ## Hello! -->

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Department of Political Economy, King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/political-economy) and a PhD Candidate at the [Hertie School's Centre for International Security ](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) in Berlin. I use computational methods to study global authoritarianism, human rights advocacy, and political communication on social media. 

My research investigates the constraints and opportunities of social media platforms for contentious politics. In my dissertation entitled _Platformed Power Plays: Authoritarian Adaptations in Foreign Social Media Spaces_, I focus on how high-capacity authoritarian regimes and their supporters use social media to exert their influence and limit dissenting voices---even on foreign platforms where their governments do not have direct control over platform governance. 

<!-- Outside of my research, I am enthusiastic about all things `R` and data visualization. I am also an advocate for diverse, accessible, and interdisciplinary communities in academic/professional settings.    -->

In a past life, I was a [Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Malaysia](https://www.macee.org.my/fulbright-eta-malaysia/) and happened to get a BSc in Economics and Asian Studies from Tulane University after living in New Orleans for four years. 

<!-- My experiences with internet/life under authoritarianism that inform my research stem from three years of studying Mandarin Chinese, and a year of living in Shanghai and Beijing. -->
