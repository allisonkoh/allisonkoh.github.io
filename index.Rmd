<!-- ## Hello! -->

I am a PhD Candidate at the [Hertie School's Centre for International Security ](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) in Berlin. My dissertation research explores the "grey areas" of digital transnational repression targeting individuals in exile/diaspora communities on Western media platforms. I am broadly interested in studying disinformation, digital repression, authoritarian politics, and applications of natural language processing in social science research. Outside of my research, I am enthusiastic about all things `R`, data visualization, lifting heavy things, and fostering inclusive spaces in academic/professional settings.   

In a past life, I was a [Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Malaysia](https://www.macee.org.my/fulbright-eta-malaysia/) and happened to get a BSc in Economics and Asian Studies from Tulane University after living in New Orleans for four years. 

<!-- My experiences with internet/life under authoritarianism that inform my research stem from three years of studying Mandarin Chinese, and a year of living in Shanghai and Beijing. -->
