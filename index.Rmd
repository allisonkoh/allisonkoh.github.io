<!-- ## Hello! -->

I am a PhD Candidate at the [Centre for International Security, Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) and Doctoral Research Fellow at the [Berlin Graduate School for Global and Transregional Studies](https://www.scripts-berlin.eu/birt/bgts/index.html). My dissertation research focuses on the contours of online smear campaigns from authoritarian contexts. I have also worked on research that applies natural language processing in the analysis of political texts and social media. Outside of my research, I am enthusiastic about all things `R`, data visualization, and advocating for a more neuroinclusive world.   

In a past life, I was a [Fulbright English Teaching Assistant in Malaysia](https://fulbrightmalaysiaeta.wordpress.com/) and happened to get a BSc in Economics and Asian Studies from Tulane University after living in New Orleans for four years.
