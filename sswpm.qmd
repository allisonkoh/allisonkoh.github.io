Hi SSWPM participants, 

Looking forward to meeting you all! See below some supplementary information to peruse/optionally prepare ahead of the short courses on <b>Functional Programming in `R`</b> and <b>Introduction to Python for `R` Users</b>. 

__Pre-requisite:__ For both courses, please have a short `R` data analysis script from your own work on hand to practice using functional programming and Python "in the wild" (if time). 

__Course materials__ (slides, handouts, notebooks) will be provided on the day through this webpage. Finalized course materials will follow after July 21st.  

## Functional Programming in `R`

This course was prepared for participants with some baseline knowledge of R/RStudio and data management. If you would like a refresher on either of these things, feel free to peruse the following materials.

Please note that some of the information related to IDEs/the tidyverse may be a bit outdated. 

- [Introduction to `R`/RStudio](files/HertieDSWorkshop_Session1.pdf)
- [Data Management in `R`](files/HertieDSWorkshop_Session2.pdf)

## Introduction to Python for `R` users

We will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for this course. You don't need to do anything to set this up outside of having a Google account. 
 
For applied examples with data, we will be using the __Partiesâ€™ Immigration and Integration Positions Dataset (PImPo)__ (Lehmann and Zobel 2018). Please download the __PImPo Party-Level DS__ CSV file from here: [https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/information/documents/pimpo](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/information/documents/pimpo). 

We will review how to load the dataset into Google Colab from your local files on the day.
