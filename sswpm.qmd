Hi SSWPM participants, 

Looking forward to meeting you all! See below some supplementary information to peruse/optionally prepare ahead of the short courses on <b>Functional Programming in `R`</b> and <b>Introduction to Python for `R` Users</b>. 

## Functional Programming in `R`

This course was prepared for participants with some baseline knowledge of R/RStudio and data management. If you would like a refresher on either of these things, feel free to peruse the following materials.

Please note that some of the information related to IDEs/the tidyverse may be a bit outdated. 

- [Introduction to `R`/RStudio](files/HertieDSWorkshop_Session1.pdf)
- [Data Management in `R`](files/HertieDSWorkshop_Session2.pdf)

_Optionally_, please bring an `R` script from your work with you to practice integrating what we cover in the course "in the wild".  

## Introduction to Python for `R` users

We will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for this course. More information to come shortly, by latest June 15th!
