She is a computational political scientist working at the intersection of international relations, political communication, and computational methods. The substantive foci of her work are the geopolitics of emerging technologies and applications of generative AI in conflict research. Her ongoing research examines the strategic landscape of digital transnational repression on social media, the state-aligned online harassment of diaspora activists, and the effect of Twitter’s recent policy changes on the influence of government and state-affiliated media accounts. Koh holds a PhD in Political Science and MPP in Policy Analysis from the Hertie School in Berlin, and completed her BSc in Economics and Asian Studies at Tulane University.\nClick here for a high-quality headshot.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The substantive foci of my work are the geopolitics of emerging technologies and applications of generative AI in conflict research. In my dissertation, I collected millions of tweets to analyze how vulnerabilities in social media companies’ platforms and policies can benefit the foreign policy interests of authoritarian regimes.\nI recently earned my PhD at the Hertie School’s Centre for International Security in Berlin.
