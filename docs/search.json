Regardless of your level of R, post your\r\ncontribution and code every week with the #TidyTuesday\r\nhashtag on Twitter and learn from others’ contributions and code. I have\r\nalso published my Tidy Tuesday contributions on Github.\r\nPackage Development\r\nThe two links below present different approaches to package\r\ndevelopment in R. The first presents best practices in\r\npackage development, while the second is more of a quick-and-dirty\r\napproach to creating an R package. My personal approach in\r\npackage dev falls somewhere between the two.\r\nR Packages by Hadley\r\nWickham and Jenny Bryan\r\nCreate\r\nR Package in 5 Minutes with roxygen2 by Dane Van Domelen\r\nI also have my own personal R package that is home to a\r\nbunch of miscellaneous functions ({kohmisc}).\r\nIt is still very new (as of September 5, 2021) and not well populated by\r\nthe functions I commonly use in my workflow, but that’s subject to\r\nchange soon!\r\nLaTeX\r\nI put together a handout on formatting basics from a LaTeX workshop I\r\nrecently taught at the Hertie School. It can be found here.\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nI have a half-baked learnr tutorial on data wrangling and\r\nvisualization in R and Python. It can be found here.\r\nI write miscellaneous coding notes-to-self and store it in this Github\r\nrepository.\r\nDo you want to publish pretty images of your code online?
