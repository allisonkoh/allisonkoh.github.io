The first presents best practices in\r\npackage development, while the second is more of a quick-and-dirty\r\napproach to creating an R package. My personal approach in\r\npackage dev falls somewhere between the two.\r\nR Packages by Hadley\r\nWickham and Jenny Bryan\r\nCreate\r\nR Package in 5 Minutes with roxygen2 by Dane Van Domelen\r\nLaTeX\r\nI put together a handout on formatting basics from a LaTeX workshop I\r\ntaught at the Hertie School during the Fall 2021 semester.
