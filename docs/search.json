Regardless of your level of R, post your contribution and code every week with the #TidyTuesday hashtag on Twitter and learn from others’ contributions and code. I have also published my Tidy Tuesday contributions on Github.\r\nPackage Development\r\nThe two links below present different approaches to package development in R. The first presents best practices in package development, while the second is more of a quick-and-dirty approach to creating an R package. My personal approach in package dev falls somewhere between the two.\r\nR Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan\r\nCreate R Package in 5 Minutes with roxygen2 by Dane Van Domelen\r\nLaTeX\r\nI put together a handout on formatting basics from a LaTeX workshop I taught at the Hertie School during the Fall 2021 semester. It can be found here.\r\nMiscellaneous\r\nI have a half-baked learnr tutorial on data wrangling and visualization in R and Python. It can be found here.\r\nI write miscellaneous coding notes-to-self and store it in this Github repository.\r\nDo you want to publish pretty images of your code online?
