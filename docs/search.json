Regardless of your level of R, post your contribution and code every week with the #TidyTuesday hashtag on Twitter and learn from others’ contributions and code. I have also published my Tidy Tuesday contributions on Github.\nPackage Development\nThe two links below present different approaches to package development in R. The first presents best practices in package development, while the second is more of a quick-and-dirty approach to creating an R package. My personal approach in package dev falls somewhere between the two.\nR Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan\nCreate R Package in 5 Minutes with roxygen2 by Dane Van Domelen\nI also have my own personal R package that is home to a bunch of miscellaneous functions ({kohmisc}). It is still very new (as of September 5, 2021) and not well populated by the functions I commonly use in my workflow, but that’s subject to change soon!\nLaTeX\nYou can find the material from the practical session on formatting basics from my LaTeX workshop here.\nMiscellaneous\nI have a half-baked learnr tutorial on data wrangling and visualization in R and Python. It can be found here.\nI write miscellaneous coding notes-to-self and store it in this Github repository.\nDo you want to publish pretty images of your code online?
