As of March 27, 2025, this is what I'm up to: 

- I currently live in London (UK). It's no NYC, but it's a close second! 
- I am a Research Fellow (postdoc) in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government). The commute between London and Birmingham is _fine_. Working with this [team](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government/people) of colleagues is pretty cool.  
- I am converting my PhD dissertation into three articles and sending them out to political science, IR, and political communication outlets. Working papers _coming soon_. 
- True to my roots as a former Tumblr/MySpace kid, I enjoy teaching myself how to code by breaking and debugging a variety of personal side quests (including this website). I'd be more than happy to teach others to do the same :) 
- I'm excited that my job allows me to travel to a bunch of places, and the Spring conference season has started! I recently went to Chicago for ISA, I'll be in Berlin for a workshop next week, Madrid for EPSA in June, and South Korea for IPSA in July. Planning some trips to see family in Taiwan and the US somewhere in between all those stops. 
- Outside of work, you can find me living by best city rat life at some pub/queer bar, art exhibition, or concert hall. If I'm not in any of those places, I'm probably hitting PRs at the gym. 
- When I'm not outside, I am probably playing some sort of action-adventure game on the PS5, watching the trashiest and/or most competitive reality tv shows you can think of (studying human behavior is truly a 24/7 special interest).
