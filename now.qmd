As of November 17, 2025, this is what I'm up to: 

- I currently live in London 🇬🇧. It's no NYC, but it's a close second! 
- I am a Research Fellow (postdoc) in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government). I mostly work remotely from London, but commute to Birmingham 1-2 times per month. 
- I am converting my PhD dissertation into three articles and sending them out to political science, IR, and/or political communication outlets. Working papers _coming soon_. 
- True to my roots as a former Tumblr/MySpace kid, I enjoy teaching myself how to code by breaking and debugging a variety of personal side quests (including this website). I'd be more than happy to teach others to do the same :) 
- My favorite work perk is location flexibility! That said, I'm very happy to be doing a little less travel at the moment. Here's where you'll find me in the coming months; please text/email me to meet up if we might be crossing paths: 
    - Mid-December: I will be in Berlin for a couple weeks, in part to attend the [Workshop on Conflict Dynamics](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/conflict-dynamics/conflict-dynamics/) at the Hertie School's Centre for International Security.
    - January: I'll be somewhere in Asia for the first couple weeks to visit family in Singapore and Taiwan.  
- Outside of work, you can find me living by best city rat life at some pub/queer bar, art exhibition, or concert hall. If I'm not in any of those places, I'm probably hitting PRs at the gym. 
- When I'm not outside, I am probably playing some sort of action-adventure game on the PS5 (currently Watchdogs Legion) or watching the trashiest and/or most competitive reality TV shows you can think of. My current favorite is Survivor.
