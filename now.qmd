As of July 22, 2024, this is what I'm up to: 

- I currently live in London (UK), and I feel like I'm finally starting to settle in after moving here last December. As a New Yorker, I feel very at home in this city!  
- I recently started my postdoc as a Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government). I'm still adjusting to the commute between London and Birmingham, but I'm very excited to be working with an amazing [team](https://x.com/allisonwkoh/status/1805289333131296830) of both new and familiar colleagues. Please reach out if you are in either city for a coffee or pint! 
- I am converting my PhD dissertation into three articles and sending them out to journals. Watch this space for links to working papers _soon_. 
- In my free time, I am learning how to lift weights without injuring myself (againðŸ˜…). I'm also looking forward to bringing my [violin](violin.html) to London in a couple months. 
- True to my roots as a former Tumblr/MySpace kid, I enjoy teaching myself how to code by breaking and debugging a variety of personal side quests (including this website, which is a work in progress). 
- I have started reading outside the context of my work as an academic. I am currently reading Judith Butler's [Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex](https://www.routledge.com/Bodies-That-Matter-On-the-Discursive-Limits-of-Sex/Butler/p/book/9780415610155).
