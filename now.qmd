As of September 24, 2024, this is what I'm up to: 

- I currently live in London (UK), and I feel like I'm finally starting to settle in after moving here last December. As a New Yorker, I feel very at home here! Please send over any recommendations for vegan-friendly street food in this city. 
- I recently started my postdoc as a Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government). I'm still adjusting to the commute between London and Birmingham, but I'm very excited to be working with an amazing [team](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government/people) of colleagues. 
- I am converting my PhD dissertation into three articles and sending them out to journals. Working papers _coming soon_. 
- In my free time, I am learning how to lift weights without injuring myself (againðŸ˜…). I also recently brought my [violin](violin.html) to London and am excited to pick it up once I take it to the shop. 
- True to my roots as a former Tumblr/MySpace kid, I enjoy teaching myself how to code by breaking and debugging via a variety of personal side quests. 
- I have started reading outside the context of my work as an academic. I am currently reading R.F. Kuang's [Babel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57945316-babel).
