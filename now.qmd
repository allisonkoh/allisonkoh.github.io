As of August 11, 2025, this is what I'm up to: 

- I currently live in London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. It's no NYC, but it's a close second! 
- I am a Research Fellow (postdoc) in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government). I mostly work remotely from London, but commute to Birmingham 1-2 times per month. 
- I am converting my PhD dissertation into three articles and sending them out to political science, IR, and/or political communication outlets. Working papers _coming soon_. 
- True to my roots as a former Tumblr/MySpace kid, I enjoy teaching myself how to code by breaking and debugging a variety of personal side quests (including this website). I'd be more than happy to teach others to do the same :) 
- My favorite work perk is that I get to travel to a bunch of places! After a busy spring/summer conference season, I'm very happy to be slowing down for the fall (for now). Here's where you'll find me in the coming months; please text/email me to meet up if we might be crossing paths: 
    - In September, I will be in Berlin for the Symposium on Crisis Early Warning. 
    - Sometime mid-October, I will be in DC (and maybe NYC beforehand)
    - In December, I will be somewhere in Asia, probably. TBD. 
- Outside of work, you can find me living by best city rat life at some pub/queer bar, art exhibition, or concert hall. If I'm not in any of those places, I'm probably hitting PRs at the gym. 
- When I'm not outside, I am probably playing some sort of action-adventure game on the PS5 (currently Far Cry 6) or watching the trashiest and/or most competitive reality TV shows you can think of (studying human behavior is truly a 24/7 special interest).
