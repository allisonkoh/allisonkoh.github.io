## `R` 

### Data Visualization 

- The [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project is a great resource for practicing data wrangling and visualization! Regardless of your level of `R`, post your contribution and code every week with the `#TidyTuesday` hashtag on Twitter and learn from others' contributions and code. I have also published my Tidy Tuesday contributions on [Github](https://github.com/allisonkoh/tidytuesday).

## Miscellaneous 

- I have a half-baked learnr tutorial on data wrangling and visualization in `R` and Python. It can be found [here](https://allison-koh.shinyapps.io/dataviz-r-python/). 
- I write miscellaneous coding notes-to-self and store it in this [Github repository](https://github.com/allisonkoh/helpful-code-stuff).
