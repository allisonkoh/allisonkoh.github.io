<h1 style="display: inline;">Allison Koh | Computational Political Scientist</h1>

<br>I am a Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government). I recently earned my PhD at the Hertie School's [Centre for International Security](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) in Berlin.   

My [research](research.html) interests lie at the intersection of international relations, political communication, and computational social science, with a focus on the <span class="text-success">__geopolitics of emerging technologies__</span> and applications of <span class="text-success">__generative AI in conflict research__</span>. In my [dissertation](research.html#dissertation), I outlined the strategic landscape of digital transnational repression on social media and identified how vulnerabilities in social media companies' transparency and content moderation policies benefit the foreign policy interests of authoritarian regimes.

Like many advanced coders, I acquired my technical skills through breaking and debugging course projects and some fun side quests, and filled my own knowledge gaps by putting together materials for technical workshops. I maintain a somewhat chaotic list of [resources](resources.html) that I've regularly consulted or put together throughout my coding (mis)adventures.

I'm from Queens, New York and am [currently](now.html) based in London.
