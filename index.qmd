<h1 style="display: inline;">Allison Koh | Computational Political Scientist</h1>

<div style="text-align: justify;">

<br>Hi! I am a Research Fellow in Natural Language Processing at the University of Birmingham's [Centre for Artificial Intelligence in Government](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government). I am also affiliated with the Hertie School's [Centre for International Security](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) in Berlin.   

My [research](research.html) lies at the intersection of international relations, political communication, and computational social science, with a focus on the <span class="text-success">__geopolitics of digital authoritarianism__</span> and applications of <span class="text-success">__AI for human rights monitoring__</span>. This work is greatly informed by previous international experience, which includes work at nonprofits, a Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship in Malaysia, and a Gilman Scholarship to support a semester abroad in China. 
<!-- There's no better way to learn about how international politics works than through navigating it firsthand.  -->

<!-- My [dissertation](research.html#dissertation) project investigated how vulnerabilities in social media companies‚Äô transparency and content moderation policies can benefit the foreign policy interests of authoritarian regimes. -->


While I spend most of my time doing research, I occasionally teach data science workshops and would be happy to do more of it. If anything in my [teaching]() portfolio aligns with your school‚Äôs or organization‚Äôs needs, please reach out!

<!-- My [dissertation](research.html#dissertation) explored the strategic landscape of digital transnational repression on social media and identified how vulnerabilities in social media companies' transparency and content moderation policies benefit the foreign policy interests of authoritarian regimes. -->

<!-- Beyond my research, I enjoy teaching myself and others how to code through hands-on experimentation and the inevitable debugging that follows. I am available to teach workshops on data management and visualization, typesetting, and web data collection.   -->

<!-- I maintain a somewhat chaotic list of [resources](links.html) that I've put together throughout my coding (mis)adventures. It includes links that I frequently consult in my workflow of breaking/debugging code and (in a future iteration) some of my teaching materials.   -->

<!-- I recently earned my PhD at the Hertie School's [Centre for International Security](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/international-security) in Berlin. I also hold an MPP in Policy Analysis from the Hertie School and a BSc in Economics and Asian Studies from Tulane University.  -->

I am [currently](now.html) based in London. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:a.w.koh@bham.ac.uk) to discuss potential opportunities, areas of mutual interest, or to grab a üçµ or üç∫ around London or Birmingham.
