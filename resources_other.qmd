## HTML5/CSS

Use `!important;` in CSS style files to override any other style rules applied to an element. It's not necessarily "best practices" to do so, but easy to implement in a pinch when you can't be bothered to make sure specific selectors are applied correctly... 

e.g.: 

```
pre {
  background-color: #f0f0f0 !important; 
}
```
